# 5. Installation and Configuration
## 5.1. Creating a new archetype template

1. Copy the file `archetypes/default.md` to a new file `archetypes/posts.md`.

2. Copy and paste the following content into the `posts.md`.

```jinja
---
author: "{{ .Site.Param "myname" }}"
title: "{{ replace .Name "-" " " | title }}"
date: "{{ strings.SliceString time.Now.Weekday.String 0 3 }}, {{ time.Now.Day }} {{ strings.SliceString time.Now.Month.String 0 3 }} {{ time.Now.Year }} {{ time.Now.Hour }}:{{ time.Now.Minute }}:{{ time.Now.Second }} +0800"
description: "{{ replace .Name "-" " " | title }}"
draft: true
hideToc: false
enableToc: true
enableTocContent: true
authorEmoji: ðŸ‘¨
---
```

Hugo looks for archetypes in the following order:
  1. `archetypes/posts.md`
  2. `archetypes/default.md`
  3. `themes/my-theme/archetypes/posts.md`
  4. `themes/my-theme/archetypes/default.md`

If none of these exists, Hugo uses a built-in default archetype.

---
# 6. Execution
## 6.1. Creating a new blog post

1. Open a new terminal, and type the following command:

  ```sh
  hugo new content posts/[TITLE].md
  ```

where TITLE should be your blog post title, e.g. `my-first-post`.

2. This should create a new markdown file in your path `content/en/posts/my-first-post.md` with a default metadata:

```md
---
author: "Dennis Lee ðŸ‘¨"
title: "My First Post"
date: "Thu, 18 Jan 2024 15:47:32 +0800"
description: "My First Post"
draft: true
hideToc: false
enableToc: true
enableTocContent: true
authorEmoji: ðŸ‘¨
---
```
