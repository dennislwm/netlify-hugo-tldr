## Introduction

There are several limitations when using a shared **WordPress (WP)** hosting. If you have used `wp-cli`, you would have known that you can perform most of the WP functions, such as publishing a new post, uploading media, etc from your local terminal, which saves a lot of time.

However, `wp-cli` requires you to have administrator access on the host computer, which is not usually granted to shared hosting users. This means that you have to perform most of the WP functions from the **WordPress** web UI, which usually takes longer to navigate and process due to the graphical load.

What is a better solution for web administrators of a shared **WordPress** hosting? 

The answer is to deploy a pipeline that can perform a single WP function, such as creating a new post, or a combination, such as minimizing and uploading images, using shell scripts and the **WordPress** RESTful APIs.

In this tutorial, you will use a Shell function to minimize multiple images and upload them to your shared **WordPress** account. You'll use the `id` of each image to perform further processing.

## Deep dive into the `curl` command

Before diving into deploying the pipeline, let's take a peek at how the WordPress RESTful API works, in particular the REST API **Media** base route `/wp-json/wp/v2/media`, with the `curl` command. 

<details>
	<summary>Click here to take a <strong>deep dive into curl</strong> command.</summary><br>

To upload an image to WordPress with `curl`, we have to specify: 
* RESTful API method `-X`
* RESTful API endpoint URL `--url`
* path of image file `--data-binary`
* multiple headers each with `-H`
* parameter `--location`

Let's look at an example:

![][1]

[1]: https://dennislwm.netlify.app/images/deploy-a-wordpress-pipeline-to-minimize-and-upload-images/curl-example.png

We use the RESTful API method `-X POST` because we are updating the image to the WordPress database. 

The RESTful API endpoint `--url` is your domain name, e.g `MYAWESOMEDOMAIN.COM` followed by `/wp-json/wp/v2/media`.

The path of image file `--data-binary` has to be prefixed by `@`, e.g. `"@/path/to/file.png"`.

The header `-H` for `content-disposition` requires a `filename=file.png`

The header `-H` for `authorization` requires a string token from your Wordpress application  `USERNAME:PASSWORD` string combination. Execute the command `echo -n "USERNAME:PASSWORD" | base64` to generate an output string token, e.g. `VVNFUk5BTUU6UEFTU1dPUkQ=`.

The header `-H` for `cache-control` disables cache, while the header `-H` for `content-type` specifies the image type, e.g. `image/png`.

And finally, the parameter `--location` will make `curl` redo the request if the requested page has moved to a new location.

</details>

### Limitation of `curl`

The limitation of using `curl` command when uploading an image file is that it only allows one file per request. Ideally, we want to be able to specify multiple files using wildcards within a single command.

## Create a deployable Shell script to minimize and upload images

In this section, let's create a Shell script in any text editor, and name the file `wprc.sh`.

This section requires both the WordPress application `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`. If you don't have these, you can generate them in the next section [Generate a WordPress application username and password](#generate-a-wordpress-application-username-and-password).

### Requirement

* WordPress application `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`
* Shell terminal, e.g. `bash`
* Shell commands `curl` and `base64`
* Any text editor

### Understand function `wp-upload`

Open the Shell file `wprc.sh`, and let's write a function to encapsulate the `curl` command, such as `wp-upload()`. This function loops through all files found within a given path, and executes the `curl` command for each file.

```
wp-upload: Minimizes and uploads image(s) to WordPress
Usage: [WP_DEBUG=false] wp-upload [WP_PATH]
Input:
  [WP_PATH]: /path/to (default: /Users/dennislwm/fx-git-pull/01transfiguration.sg/minify)
```

The function accepts one parameter, which is the given path the the image files, e.g. `/path/to`. We should assert that at least one valid file in the path before running the loop.

The onus is on the user to ensure that all files in the given path are image files, e.g. `jpeg` or `png`, that are supported by the HTTP `application/type`. For example `image/jpeg` is supported, but not `jpg`.

Some common image types are:
* `image/apng`
* `image/avif`
* `image/gif`
* `image/jpeg`
* `image/png`
* `image/svg+xml`
* `image/webp`

The Shell method extracts and sets the `image/TYPE` from the extension of each file, e.g. `filename.jpeg`. If the image type is invalid, then the `curl` command will fail. Hence, the user has to ensure that the extension of each file corresponds to a valid image type, e.g. `filename.svg+xml`.

### Execute command `wp-upload`

The environment variables `WP_USERNAME` and `WP_PASSWORD` are required for WordPress authentication. You can save these variables in a separate file, one variable per line, such as `env.sh` and load the variables with `source env.sh` before running the function.

Alternatively, you can set these variables at each command as follows:

`$ WP_USERNAME=USERNAME WP_PASSWORD=PASSWORD wp-upload`

The function prompts for a user confirmation before executing the `curl` command.

```
  WP_PATH=/Users/dennislwm/fx-git-pull/01transfiguration.sg/minify
Upload 2 image(s) to WordPress? 
Enter yes to confirm; OR BLANK to quit: yes
```

The only accepted value is `yes`, as all other values will terminate the function. For each file upload that succeeds, the media `id` is returned, e.g. `5873`.

```

5874
done
```

### Debug function `wp-upload`

The function has a debug mode `WP_DEBUG=true` that prints the `curl` command for each file without executing it. 

<details>
	<summary>Click here to <strong>debug function wp-upload</strong>.</summary><br>

`$ WP_DEBUG=true wp-upload`

The result is as follows:

```
Uploading BlessingsInHarmony.jpeg
curl -X POST --url https://transfiguration.sg/wp-json/wp/v2/media --data-binary "@/Users/dennislwm/fx-git-pull/01transfiguration.sg/minify/BlessingsInHarmony.jpeg" -H "content-disposition: attachment; filename=BlessingsInHarmony.jpeg" -H "authorization: Basic ZGVubmlzbHdtOmx2Y2cgRUFYTSBib29GIDlNTU4gSEROZiBzU3RO" -H "cache-control: no-cache" -H "content-type: image/jpeg" --location
Uploading Order_Xmas T-Shirt.png
curl -X POST --url https://transfiguration.sg/wp-json/wp/v2/media --data-binary "@/Users/dennislwm/fx-git-pull/01transfiguration.sg/minify/Order_Xmas T-Shirt.png" -H "content-disposition: attachment; filename=Order_Xmas T-Shirt.png" -H "authorization: Basic ZGVubmlzbHdtOmx2Y2cgRUFYTSBib29GIDlNTU4gSEROZiBzU3RO" -H "cache-control: no-cache" -H "content-type: image/png" --location
done
```

</details>

### Source code `wprc.sh`

The source code of `wprc.sh` contains both the functions `wp-upload` and `inp-confirm`. Before running these commands, you have to load the file with `source wprc.sh`.

## Generate a WordPress application username and password

### Requirement

* **WordPress** GUI admin access
* WordPress **iThemes Security** plugin
* WordPress **Application Passwords** plugin

### WordPress REST API

The **iThemes Security** plugin offers a setting to **Restrict Access** to most REST API data.

1. To activate the setting, navigate to `Security` > `Settings` > `WordPress Tweaks` > `Configure Settings`

2. Scroll to the **REST API** section, and select the `Restricted Access` setting.

The plugin can only enable/disable access to _everyone_ at once, however, it's not possible to allow specific users to access the REST API.

#### Allow Specific Users to the WP REST API

##### Install Application Passwords Plugin

In order to allow a specific user (or application) to access the REST API, you must install the **Application Passwords** plugin.

<details>
  <summary>Click here to <strong>install Application Passwords plugin</strong>.</summary><br>

1. Navigate to `Plugins` > `Add New` > Type `Application Passwords` in the Search box > Press `Enter` key > Click `Install Now` on the plugin.

2. To allow a specific user, navigate to `Users` > `All Users` > Click `Edit` for the `USERNAME` that you want to enable access.

3. Scroll to the **Application Passwords** section, and type a new **Application Name** and Click `Add New`.

4. Copy down the generated password, e.g. `S5hd Tp3K GdhU GFXd zJhQ Wtwa`

</details>

##### Test Specific User Access to the WP REST API

The WP REST API **Media** base route is `/wp-json/wp/v2/media`. This [API Reference](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference) provides information about the specific endpoints available through the API, their parameters, and their response data format.

For example, if the host is `transfiguration.sg`, then the URL is `https://transfiguration/wp-json/wp/v2/media`.

<details>
  <summary>Click here to <strong>test specific user access to the WP REST API</strong>.</summary><br>

1. Open a terminal and type the following command. Replace `USERNAME:PASSWORD` with your username and application password.

![][3]

[3]: https://dennislwm.netlify.app/images/deploy-a-wordpress-pipeline-to-minimize-and-upload-images/curl-test.png

2. If successfully connected, you should get a `JSON` response. For example:

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you used a Shell function to minimize multiple images and upload them to your shared **WordPress** account. You then used the `id` of each image to perform further processing.

## What To Do Next

* Implement Compression - This is to minimize each image before uploading, e.g. package the Node.js script that uses `gulp-imagemin` into an executable.
* Implement Assertions - This is to check for valid extensions of each image file to ensure that the `curl` command doesn't fail, e.g. `jpg` is not a valid extension.
* Implement Pipeline - This is to trigger the Shell function from a pipeline, e.g. execute `wp-upload` on a `git push`.
* Add Processing - This is to process each image file uploaded given their unique IDs.

## Troubleshooting

### Error Access to REST API requests is restricted by iThemes Security settings.

You need to install **Application Passwords** plugin, and allow a specific user to access WP REST API.

Ensure that your username and application password is correct, when passed as a `base64` string to WP REST API **Basic Authentication**.
