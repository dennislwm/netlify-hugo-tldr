If you have bought a domain name, such as `myawesomedomain.com`, you would know that it will require a SSL certificate for `HTTPS` connection. However, the SSL certificate is an additional cost that requires renewal each year.

For a **Namecheap** domain, a one-year **PositiveSSL** certificate costs about $10, which is almost the same cost as the domain name itself. Fortunately, there is an alternative where you can manually install a 90-day SSL certificate from **Let's Encrypt** `certbot` at zero cost.

## Requirement

* cPanel console access
* `certbot`
* `cert.pem`
* `privkey.pem`

## Install SSL certificate and private key with cPanel console

This section requires both the files `privkey.pem` and `cert.pem`. If you don't have these files, you can generate them in the next section.

1. Navigate to your cPanel > Security > SSL/TLS > INSTALL AND MANAGE SSL FOR YOUR SITE (HTTPS) > Manage SSL sites

2. Select a Domain > `myawesomedomain.com (+ subdomains: mail, www, ...)`

3. In the `Certificate: (CRT)` field, copy and paste the contents of your `certificate.pem`.

4. In the `Private Key (KEY)` field, copy and paste the contents of your `private_key.pem`.

5. In the `Certificate Authority Bundle: (CABUNDLE)` field, leave it as blank (default).

6. Click `Install Certificate`.

7. Navigate to your cPanel > Security > SSL/TLS Status

This displays a list of domains and subdomains that are managed by cPanel and their certificate status. We use a wildcard, such as `*.myawesomedomain.com`, when generating a SSL certificate to avoid repetition.

## Generate a SSL certificate and private key with certbot

A simple web application needs to be developed with generated token in order to accept the challenge (domain verification) by **Let's Encrypt** server. The new method, DNS challenge, drastically simplifies the verification process to get or to renew the certificate.

### Step 1 - Install `certbot`

`brew install certbot`

### Step 2 - Generate new certificate using `certbot` 

You can generate the certificate for a single domain, or for multiple domains (using wildcards). In this case, I used `*.myawesomedomain.com` so that the certificate can be used for subdomains as well.

`sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns -d "*.myawesomedomain.com"`

The wizard will revert with a `DNS TXT` record that must be deployed before you can continue.

Please deploy a DNS TXT record under the name:

_acme-challenge.myawesomedomain.com.

with the following value:

ssalkdfj39823j4lisdr02948u0owtguj209345u209

Before continuing, verify the TXT record has been deployed. Depending on the DNS
provider, this may take some time, from a few seconds to multiple minutes. You can
check if it has finished deploying with aid of online tools, such as the Google
Admin Toolbox: https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/_acme-challenge.myawesomedomain.com.
Look for one or more bolded line(s) below the line ';ANSWER'. It should show the
value(s) you've just added.

Press Enter to Continue
```

### Step 3 - Deploy DNS TXT record in Namecheap

1. Navigate to Namecheap console > Dashboard > `myawesomedomain.com` > Manage
2. Navigate to Domain > Ensure Nameservers is `Namecheap BasicDNS`
3. Navigate to Advanced DNS > ADD NEW RECORD
	a. Enter Type `TXT Record`
	b. Enter Host `_acme-challenge`
	c. Enter Value `ssalkdfj39823j4lisdr02948u0owtguj209345u209`
	d. Enter TTL `1 min` or `60` (seconds)
4. Verify this `DNS TXT` record using `nslookup`. Depending on the DNS
provider, this may take some time, from a few seconds to multiple minutes.
	`nslookup -type=TXT _acme-challenge.myawesomedomain.com`

```Server:		192.168.86.1
Address:	192.168.86.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
_acme-challenge.myawesomedomain.com	text = "ssalkdfj39823j4lisdr02948u0owtguj209345u209"

Authoritative answers can be found from:

### Step 4 - Complete the `certbot` wizard

Return to the `certbot` wizard and press `Enter`.

```
Press Enter to Continue

Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/myawesomedomain.com/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/myawesomedomain.com/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2022-01-30.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.

NEXT STEPS:
- This certificate will not be renewed automatically. Autorenewal of --manual certificates requires the use of an authentication hook script (--manual-auth-hook) but one was not provided. To renew this certificate, repeat this same certbot command before the certificate's expiry date.
```

The `certbot` outputs FOUR (4) `pem` files, which can be found in the path `/etc/letsencrypt/live/myawesomedomain.com/`. The certificate is valid for 90 days and cannot be extended (Let's Encrypt's policy).

* `cert.pem` (required)
* `privkey.pem` (required)
* `chain.pem`
* `fullchain.pem`
